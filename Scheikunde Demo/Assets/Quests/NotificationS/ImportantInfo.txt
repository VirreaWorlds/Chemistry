Change the functions which play the sounds for the quests/objectives to QuestManager.instance.nSpawner.CreateNewNotification(quest/objective) + SpawnSound

NotificationSpawner needs to be on the same object as the questmanager

Target object needs to be placed on the centereyeanchor of the vr rig

Dont forget to add the createnotification function to ALL places. I forgot the objective-specific

Change the text objects which show "Objectives:" to "Taken:" as it needs to be dutch.


Add this in CheckFull.cs on the bottom of the Update():
//

        if(dezeParent.transform.position.y > transform.position.y)
        {
            if (Voll)
            {
                DeleteStof();
            }
        }

//
